## Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local system.

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- CMake (version 3.18 or newer)
- g++ compiler
- Python (only if using the Python bindings)
- pybind11 (only if using the Python bindings)

### Compilation

Execute these commands from the root directory of the project to compile the library:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Documentation

The complete documentation for the library is available at the following link: [Library Documentation](https://information-reconciliation-for-cv-qkd.readthedocs.io/).
